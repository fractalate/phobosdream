Things I say about me on the internet.

## The Elements Discord

Hello everyone, I'm phobosDREAM, a software engineer and math twitch streamer. You can find me on [twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/phobosdream), [GitHub](https://github.com/fractalate/phobosdream), and here on Discord.

I enjoy problem solving and generally focus on math problems from standardized tests like the [GRE subject tests](https://www.ets.org/gre/score-users/about/subject-tests.html) administered in the United States and the [JEE Advanced exam](https://www.jeeadv.ac.in/) administered in India. You'll also see me stream about some of my current areas of studies which include:

* Computational Physics
* Computer Science
* Data Analysis and Visualization

Sometimes you'll find me streaming my favorite game, [Final Fantasy XIV](https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/).

If you're having trouble with some code, I can help! Post about it in chat here, in the #coding channel, or in an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/fractalate/phobosdream/issues/new?body=%3CYOUR%20QUESTION%20HERE%3E&labels=question).

See you around!
