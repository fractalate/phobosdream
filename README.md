## Topics

I enjoy problem solving and generally focus on math problems from standardized tests like the [GRE subject tests](https://www.ets.org/gre/score-users/about/subject-tests.html) administered in the United States and the [JEE Advanced exam](https://www.jeeadv.ac.in/) administered in India. You'll also see me stream about some of my current areas of studies which include:

* Computational Physics
  - [Newman, Computational Physics](https://github.com/fractalate/study-newman-computational-physics)
  - [Simulation of an Accelerometer in Space](https://github.com/fractalate/simulation-accelerometer-in-space)
  - [Simulation of the Heat Equation](https://github.com/fractalate/simulation-heat-equation-1d)
* Computer Science
  - [General Computer Science Materials](https://github.com/fractalate/compsci)
  - [CLRS Introduction to Algorithms](https://github.com/fractalate/study-clrs-introduction-to-algorithms)
* Data Analysis and Visualization
  - [Trees of Chicago](https://github.com/fractalate/data-trees-chicago)
  - [Trees of Seattle](https://github.com/fractalate/data-trees-seattle)
* Problem Sets
  - [Several Problems](https://github.com/fractalate/several-problems)

Sometimes you'll find me streaming my favorite game, [Final Fantasy XIV](https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/).
