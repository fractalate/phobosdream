# Welcome to phobosDREAM's Stream Repository!

Check out my streams on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/phobosdream)! **Note:** I'll be around from time to time, but I'm busiest in the fall so I can't commit to scheduled streams.

Having trouble with some code you've been working on? Have a math question? [Open an issue](https://github.com/fractalate/phobosdream/issues/new?body=%3CYOUR%20QUESTION%20HERE%3E&labels=question) or [ask on Discord](https://discord.gg/wPFKP5K9MF) and I'd be happy to have a look!

Looking for a code roast? [Open an issue](https://github.com/fractalate/phobosdream/issues/new?body=%3CGIVE%20ME%20A%20LINK%20TO%20YOUR%20CODE%20AND%20GIVE%20ME%20A%20BRIEF%20OVERVIEW%20OF%20WHAT%20I%27M%20LOOKING%20AT%20HERE%3E&labels=code%20roast)!

## Topics

I enjoy problem solving and generally focus on math problems from standardized tests like the [GRE subject tests](https://www.ets.org/gre/score-users/about/subject-tests.html) administered in the United States and the [JEE Advanced exam](https://www.jeeadv.ac.in/) administered in India. You'll also see me stream about some of my current areas of studies which include:

* Computational Physics
* Computer Science
* Data Analysis and Visualization

Sometimes you'll find me streaming my favorie game, [Final Fantasy XIV](https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/).
